## What is Angular4-BaseProject?

Angular4-BaseProject  is a front-end Admin Dashboard application based on Angular 4, Bootstrap 4 and Webpack.

## How can it help me?

Angular4-BaseProject aims to bootstrap the development of your product and provide an ecosystem for building production-ready application or prototypes.

Angular4-BaseProject uses a library called ngrx/store which is Redux-inspired architecture  and implements usage of observables and async pipe for building the application.The fundamental premise of redux is that the entire state of the application is represented in a single JavaScript object called a store,or application store, that can be acted upon using special functions called reducers. 

Just as modern web frameworks like Angular permanently altered our jQuery-centric approach to app development,React has fundamentally changed the way that we approach state-management while using modern web frameworks. Redux is front and center of this shift as it introduced an elegant, yet profoundly simple way to manage application state. It is worth mentioning, Redux is a library but more importantly it is a design pattern that is completely framework agnostic and coincidentally works really well with Angular.

Frameworks like Bootstrap provide a number of components, but usually it's not enough to build a real-world app. This application comes with lots of popular UI components with a unified color scheme, 
plus it is based on a modern Angular 4 framework and has a flexible component based structure.

You can also use Angular4-BaseProject for the purpose of learning Angular 4.
